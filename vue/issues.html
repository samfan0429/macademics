    <h1>List of Known issues</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>No labs are shown as course options</li>
            <details>
                This is probably due to scraping parameteres. Most likely due to regex. <br>
                This leads to required lab sections not being added to the summary. <br>
                Wwe need to automatically add a lab row when choosing that lab's parent course.

            <br>

        <li>Different topics courses are grouped as one if same course number</li>
            <details>
                This is due to data modeling based upon grouping of course number <br>
                This leads to totally different course content seemingly appear as different sections of one same course. <br>
                We need to add a way to display as a different course. Maybe we can do this based  upon the naming scheme of topics courses - X9X.

        <li>No real-time search of text</li>
            <details>
                This is due to Firestore's limitation. <br>
                This leads to more requirement of user interaction. <br>
                We can add this featuere when we figure out how to use Algolia. We can also search among the course details as an added benefit.
