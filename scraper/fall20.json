We will study major genres, such as slave narratives and poetry, and movements, including the Harlem Renaissance and Afrofuturism. We will learn to use the tools and vocabulary of literary analysis to read closely, critically, and appreciatively. Themes of national critique, solidarity, and joy will organize and focus our study. Authors will include: Frederick Douglass, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, and Ross Gay, among others. Requirements include: brief written responses to the readings, two essays of about 5 pages (one of which must be revised), and a final project. This course will fulfill either the foundation course in literature requirement or the literature by U.S. writers of color requirement for the English major.",

European (and, later, Euro-Americans) alternated among fascination, fear, and frustration toward American Indians, while American Indians sought to maintain tribal sovereignty and control over their lands, cultures, religions, politics, and lifestyles amidst continuing encroachment and settlement. This course examines American Indian history to 1871 - the year that Congress stopped making treaties with Native nations - by considering the complicated and multifaceted history of the nation's indigenous people. By looking at American Indian interactions with Spanish, French, British, and American explorers, settlers, missionaries, militaries, and government officials, this courses argues that the history of American Indians is essential to understanding past as well as present issues. Furthermore, this course looks to move beyond the notion that American Indian history is one of inevitable decline by creating a more nuanced understanding of the American Indian experience from pre-contact toward the twentieth century.",

Case studies will include ancient and historic infections such as smallpox, tuberculosis, and plague as well as newer infections such as HIV, Ebola, and COVID-19.  We will also examine the evolution of antibiotic resistance, the impact of disease stigma, and applications for global health policies dealing with future pandemics.

An anti-colonial diatribe, the Surrealists\u2019 map drew attention to many other important places -- Mexico, Latin America, the Caribbean, Russia, and Africa--where the Surrealist imaginary flourished, shaping identities and confronting diverse forms of oppression. Examining art, film, and theoretical perspectives that framed surrealist goals and practices from the 1920s to the present, we will address topics such as amour fou (mad love), convulsive beauty, the fantastic, the uncanny, language and madness, black humor, magic and occult, Negritude, and Afro-Surrealism.",

This course introduces Uyghur culture, language, literature, religion, and art from both historical and ethnographic perspectives. Course materials address topics such as minority nationalism, representation, Islamophobia, mass incarceration, and contested histories, while also taking a critical look at discourses of pluralism, terrorism, and the \u201cSilk Road.\u201d Music and performing arts are highly valued in Uyghur societies and often venues where identities are performed. We will listen closely to major genres of traditional and modern Uyghur music, and be involved in a small-scale performance of an early modern Uyghur drama. There is no prerequisite; no prior knowledge of music, Turkic languages, or Chinese is assumed.",

            "description": "Mindfulness, a state of active, open (non-judgmental) attention on the present, is as Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh puts it, \u201cthe most reliable source of peace and joy\u201d.  It has roots in Buddhism, however, most religious traditions practice some form of meditation or prayer which helps to gain a broader perspective on life and an appreciation of the present.  A rapidly growing body of scientific evidence supports the findings that meditation can have a profound effect on our health and well-being, often through stress reduction.  The practice of mindfulness meditation emerged into mainstream medicine, in part, through the efforts of Professor emeritus Jon Kabat-Zinn, who is the founder and former director of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.   MBSR techniques and training are now used in many clinical and academic settings, including Macalester College.    MBSR and other meditation techniques have been shown to have a profound effect on reducing stress, lowering blood pressure, reducing chronic pain and more.  In this class, we will read and discuss research articles on the \u201cscience of mindfulness\u201d and how mindfulness practices impact our health and well-being.   You will also be writing a multi-draft review paper on a related topic and presenting your findings to the class.   One of my main goals for this class is to reduce stress and promote individual health, developing practices for now and future present moments.  For this reason, I will ask students to commit to a daily of practice of mindfulness.  Training in these practices will be part of the class.

We study the nature of chemical bonding and how bonding gives rise to the three-dimensional structure of matter. We explore how the macroscopic properties of substances can be interpreted in terms of atomic and molecular structure. We also learn mathematical and conceptual tools for quantifying chemical equilibrium, with an emphasis on the reactions of acids and bases. Laboratory work reinforces concepts in lecture, and also provides a review of fundamental topics, such as stoichiometry, gas laws, and solution-phase reactions, that are essential for future course work in chemistry.

The emphasis throughout the course will be on the use of computers to make predictions, instead of the mathematics and physics underlying quantum mechanics.\u00a0 The second half of the course focuses on research projects possibly leading to publication.

We will systematically over the course of the semester talk about issues of concern as you begin your college career, social and academic. We will learn how to use the library resources, the MAX tutoring center, the office of Career Exploration, and the Hamre Center for Health and Wellness.

Together we will investigate when and why people wrote on stuff in the Roman Empire, the types of evidence that this writing provides, how scholars have used epigraphy to approach a variety of research questions, and how to work with modern publications to pursue such research yourself. We will also devote a couple of weeks both to reading extended prose in the form of a famous epitaph of an unknown woman, the so-called LaudatioTuriae, and to texts selected by members of the class.

We will start by considering debates over freedom of speech, privacy, surveillance, and intellectual property: issues that pre-exist the development of the Internet, but which because of it have taken on new dimensions. From here we will go on to take up some ethical questions arising from four different domains of activity on the social web: gaming, social networking, blog/wiki developing, and \"hacktivism.\" In the third part of the course, we will consider broad questions connected to the integration of the Internet with devices other than the personal computer and mobile phone and which open the prospect of a world of integrated networked systems. What are some of the impacts of such integration on our everyday ethical relations with others and on the overall quality of our lives? How does being networked affect the meaning of being human?",

As a result, VR has quickly emerged at the front edge of experimentation in storytelling and narrative design. It has also become one of the most creative popular-cultural sites for experimenting with understanding other minds and identities. Cross-listed between Computer Science and English, this course is an introduction to the challenge of building immersive virtual reality (VR) games through the lens of narrative and storytelling.

The course encompasses a comparative view of education around the world, as well as its role in International Development. We take it further, by analysis and critique, to understand education as a force for change in an inter-dependent, globalized world. Specifically, we will examine ways in which policies and practice either enhance or diminish efforts towards change that is inclusive, just, sustainable and effective in relieveing suffering, while expanding potential and capacity in those affected by social change. We take the position that, in order to be effective, building trust becomes a key to connectivity between people, groups, organizations and ideas where education, development and change are theorized and practiced. We will construct possible education frameworks around the idea of building trust, by analyzing socio-cultural issues of power, voice, silence, and discourse. (4 credits)",

In this introductory course, you will read literature across genres, thinking in multimodal ways about the intersection of literature and craft. Our class will study this intersection by reading literary texts that engage with the idea of craft, design, and makerspaces through practices as diverse as embroidery, knitting, quilting, painting, collage, zines, and pottery. We will ask questions about the ways in which craft critiques power structures, queers the gender binary, and helps people process and heal from trauma. Students do not need to have particular expertise in art or craft but should be willing to experiment, learn, and build a craft toolkit for various hands-on components of the class",

What are the stories we tell ourselves about human\u2019s relationship to the Earth? Where do we find hope for our futures? A timely look at the concept of \u201cThe Anthropocene\u201d provides us with special opportunities for self-reflection, debate and expression. Our fiction and non-fiction readings, film screenings and experiential learning will help us answer if there could be such a thing as a \u201cgood\u201d Anthropocene rather than simply an apocalyptic one. We will develop our writing and research skills working on collaborative projects with the Twin Cities as our backdrop.

Forster's Lucy Honeychurch, who \"entered into a more solid world when she opened the piano,\" to James Baldwin's Sonny, who \"moved in an atmosphere which wasn't like theirs at all,\" fictional musicians encounter trouble when negotiating the conflicting realms of art and society. Experts in one kind of expression, they fail in others. What draws these characters to music? What does it offer them? What is its value to us? In the musical novel and short story, we encounter music as an agent of violence, of consolation, of transcendence and redemption as well as damnation. We witness empathy through music, but we also learn that shared feeling can be both beautiful and dangerous, that music unites and divides. This course combines the close reading of literary texts (as well as works of literary theory and musicology) with the examination of the musical contexts that inform and inspire them. We will explore, for example, the relationship between Kazuo Ishiguro's novel The Unconsoled and Richard Wagner's music drama Parsifal. We will talk about syncopation in \"jazz\" by Charles Mingus and Toni Morrison. We will watch Marguerite Duras and Katherine Mansfield turn innocuous music lessons into spaces of wretchedness. We will try to understand what David Mitchell's young composer Robert Frobisher means when he says, \"One writes music because winter is eternal and because, if one didn't, the wolves and blizzards would be at one's throat all the sooner.\"",

Emerson, Hawthorne, Stowe, Thoreau, Douglass, Melville, Dickinson, Whitman, and Jacobs - together these artists produced a canon of literature that revealed both the demons and angels of our histories and futures. They invented a spiritual movement of unprecedented optimism at the same time that they despaired over what they had become. Everything that was written in the US afterwards would have to come to terms with the brilliant and disturbing achievements of this cluster of outsiders, mystics, and heroes.

In-class exercises and prompts, and small-group workshopping and reading will challenge each writer's individual development.

In this course, we will study the origins of this popular genre of entertainment by reading Capellanus\u2019s The Art of Courtly Love, Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes\u2019s Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart, the Lais of Marie de France, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and The Romance of Silence. We will query what constitutes romance as a coherent literary genre and then trace its development across time and space, looking at texts such as Shakespeare\u2019s The Winter\u2019s Tale and Behn\u2019s Oroonoko, as well as contemporary \u201crom-com\u201d films such as Crazy Rich Asians and The Photograph.

The rigors of early modern law may seem strange or \u201cbarbaric\u201d to us, yet we may recognize the intentions behind the laws: to restore order, to keep the peace, and to stabilize social relations. To grasp what justice meant to the early moderns and, in turn, what it means to us today, we will examine some of Shakespeare\u2019s most challenging plays through the lens of legal and political philosophy. Plays such as Titus Andronicus, The Merchant of Venice, Measure for Measure, King Lear, and Othello stage a spectrum of responses to insult, injury, and violence. At the same time, the texts trouble the division between good and evil, justice and revenge. Our agenda is two-fold: to deepen our reading of Shakespearean drama and to use our knowledge to investigate difficult and still unresolved questions about the problem of evil, the dialectic between law and justice, and the meaning of the \u201cgood life.\u201d Counts for the Legal Studies concentration.

The first goal is to provide students with the opportunity to develop an original research project that reflects their deepest aesthetic interests and ethical commitments. Working closely with a faculty member and a small group of peers, students will develop projects that display rigorous literary scholarship and methodological inventiveness. The second goal is to provide instruction in advanced methods of research by studying influential critical approaches from the early twentieth century to the present. Specific theories and methods will be determined in consultation with the instructor. Past courses have emphasized psychoanalysis, post-Marxist criticism, gender, queer, and feminist theory, phenomenology, critical race theory, black feminist theory, post-colonial criticism, poetics, law and human rights, and aesthetics. The final goal is to train students to become advocates of their research agenda. Students will learn to lecture and lead discussion on relevant readings and to share their research with the wider intellectual community in a form that reflects the spirit of the project. Prerequisite(s): One prior English course numbered in the 100s (excluding 101 or 150), plus one literature course at the 200- or 300- level. Capstone courses are intended to be a culminating experience for the major. Students without Senior status will need instructor permission to enroll.",

            "description": "All your writing for the past three years has led you to this point. But what did you get instead? A plague torpedoing your momentum, erasing class as you know it, and forcing you to adopt new ways to learn. So, let\u2019s write our way through it. The Original Decameron, written in the 14th-century by Italian author Giovanni Boccaccio was itself a response to great plague. The SparkNotes version: The book is structured as a frame story containing 100 tales told by a group of seven young women and three young men sheltering in a secluded villa just outside Florence to escape the Black Death, which was afflicting the city. Boccaccio himself, probably conceived the thing after the epidemic of 1348. So, for the Fiction capstone you will be writing stories (several stories) but they will all contribute to one publication, a class Decameron (that we might even publish!). Yes, as with the original Decameron we will hew close to several themes, and yes in the end the stories should work together, even  loosely, but the main goal is to take what you have learned over the past few years, and push yourselves out of the boundaries of fiction, out of genre, out of your own taboos, even out of what we\u2019ve come to accept as literature. Along with these stories you will encouraged to submit verses, illustrations, photos, doodles, and journal entries to let us know where and how you are as you write. You have written the short story, several flash fictions, or maybe taken a stab at the novella. Now is the time to cap your literary life on a big note, and go for something that adds up to something larger. This is an Advanced Writers Workshop, which means all the time will be spent writing and reading as writers. We will present new and revised work, critique and encourage, and more than anything else work towards that moment where all that\u2019s left to write is THE END. Prerequisites: permission of instructor; rising senior and/or has completed all coursework. PS: It goes without saying that you should read the actual Decameron. I also highly recommend Pasolini\u2019s film version.",

A timely look at the concept of \u201cThe Anthropocene\u201d provides us with special opportunities for self-reflection, debate and expression. Our fiction and non-fiction readings, film screenings and experiential learning will help us answer if there could be such a thing as a \u201cgood\u201d Anthropocene rather than simply an apocalyptic one. We will develop our writing and research skills working on collaborative projects with the Twin Cities as our backdrop. This interdisciplinary course is being co-taught by faculty from three different departments: Andrea Kaston Tange (English), John Kim (Media and Cultural Studies) and Roopali Phadke (Environmental Studies).

Beyond agriculture, we will also examine other sectoral issues in relation to agriculture or as stand alone environmental concerns. These themes include: human population growth, consumption, biodiversity, climate change, and environmental health. We will be trying on a number of theoretical lenses from geography's broad human-environment tradition (such as physical geography, cultural ecology, commodity chain analysis, political ecology, resource geography, the human dimensions of global change, hazards geography and environmental justice). In other words, I not only want us to explore a range of environmental issues, but also to grapple with theory and how this informs our understanding of the human-environment interface.",

For each of these hazard types, we apply theoretical concepts from major hazards research paradigms, including quantifying the human and economic impacts of disaster; assessing, managing, and mitigating risk; and reducing the impacts of disaster, not only through engineering works but also by reducing social vulnerability and enhancing adaptive capacity. Looking into the future, we will discuss how global-scale processes, such as climate change and globalization, might affect the frequency, intensity, and geographical distribution of environmental hazards in the decades to come.",

Course readings focus on suburbs, which are the dominant mode of metropolitan living in contemporary America. We will consider the history of suburbanization, the political economy of growth in the suburbs, the rise of smart growth strategies, and other attempts to foster change in the suburban experience (including the New Urbanism, green building and green movements, and regionalism). We will also consider how suburbs are now experiencing demographic changes and investigate the struggle for community in historic and contemporary suburbs. This seminar will thus complicate the conventional narrative of suburbs as sprawling, inauthentic and homogeneous places. Students will further enrich their understanding of issues covered in the course by conducting original research that examines ways in which American suburbs are changing and/or remaining the same despite efforts to the contrary. Students will consider their collective findings and discuss what they portend for American cities in the 21st century.",

The course is thus not a systematic survey of all French and francophone literature, but we will study many different genres (film, theater, autobiography, short story, essay, novel, poetry, song) and several different time periods to explore how empathy has been expressed in French and francophone societies over the centuries.  We will also work on a number of writing projects that will prepare you for upper-level courses in French and for study abroad in France or a francophone region.  This course is taught in French. Required for the French major and all 400-level courses in French. Prerequisite: French 204.",

Class sessions will mostly consist of screenings with short response papers as follow-ups. Some screenings will be scheduled outside of regular class hours or assigned as homework. There will be several interactive sessions with documentary filmmakers, performance artists, and critics, across all segments of contemporary francophone Africa. In addition, we will discuss secondary readings that address a host of issues such as, among others: the environmental footprint of colonialism; the nonfictional content of fictional features; the contested \u201cdocumentary value\u201d of historical genres such as the biopic and the epic; the tight correlation between genre aesthetics and gender politics; issues of self-performance in mixed genres (domestic ethnography, web-i-docs, mockumentaries); postcolonial francophone documentary as an ethics of care and transcultural cinematic empathy.

            "description": "IIn this course, we will examine representations of the sacred and the profane in French literature and culture from the early modern period through to the present. We will consider the sacred and religious dimensions of pre-modern French society via iconic figures including Joan of Arc; the medieval coronation ceremony (sacre des rois); the carnaval; and texts on demonology, witchcraft, and spirit possession. We will then explore the connections between Enlightenment rationality and materialism and the so-called \u201cSuper-Enlightenment\u201d in which many leading eighteenth-century figures also dabbled: alchemy, arcana and the occult, the secret societies (Freemasons and Illuminati) accused of plotting the Revolution, and mysticism and speculative metaphysics. In the 19th century we will explore themes of transcendence, profanation, and excess in decadent poetry and the literature of the fantastique, and read texts on drugs (opium and hashish), and their relationship to dreams and the unconscious. Finally, we will explore secularization in contemporary France, the revolutionary history and specificity of French la\u00efcit\u00e9 and its relationship to the \u201creligions du Livre\u201d (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), and French anxieties about the loss of transcendence and the retreat of religion from national and civic life, and its simultaneous return in the form of the religion of the \u2018other.\u2019  Prerequisite: French 306",

This course begins with an exploration of global flows and connections, and then takes us on a scholarly tour of the world, with stop offs in Africa, the Middle East, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Along the way we'll systematically investigate major human and physical geography themes such as population dynamics and migration, agricultural change, human-environment interactions, health and disease, economic change and development, urbanization, and cultural shifts.

And yet every year, hundreds of millions of people continue to move into cities to pursue a better future. The contemporary social, economic, and political changes are intrinsically linked to divergent urban processes across the world. This paramount shift poses important theoretical and empirical questions to our age. This course uses the critical perspective of \"global urbanism\" to both contextualize and connect different urban experiences across places. We will introduce various urban settings and demonstrate how complex relations between urbanization, globalization, and economic development produce spatial unevenness and social inequality. We will study the dominant paradigm of world and global cities, which prioritizes development trajectories of cities in the global North, and discuss contesting views focusing on \"ordinary cities\" from the global South. Drawing on case studies in the developed and less-developed world, we will also learn how to apply the relational comparative urbanism approach as well as regionally based theoretical perspectives to comprehend the diverse urban landscapes around the globe.",

Home is intimately connected to place and broadly conceptualized environments.   In this course we will engage with and draw upon several overlapping literatures grounded in inter-disciplinary perspectives offered in migration studies.  Course topics may include migration, diaspora, home, environment and environmental change, identity, place, belonging, as well as material expressions of these ideas, including art, architecture, symbolic places and monuments.  Through an exploration of case studies both here in the Twin Cities as well as those drawn from around the world, this course offers an introduction to the basic principles and theories of migration and the ways in which migrants shape and transform place and are in turn shaped and transformed by their experience of place and home.   Migration challenges us to consider different conceptualizations of home, belonging and identity.  As such, this course offers an introduction to these concepts through discussion, field excursions and student-designed projects.",

In this course, the focus is on the interpretation and applications of data from spaceborne imaging systems (e.g.\u00a0Landsat MMS, Landsat TM, ETM+,\u00a0MODIS, Sentinel-2). Students will learn the fundamentals of remote sensing through the use of problem solving and spatial thinking skills.\u00a0The number of disciplines which utilize remotely sensed data continues to increase. Geologists, geographers, climatologists, and ecologists have all adapted remote sensing techniques to their respective research. This course will discuss many different uses of remotely sensed data, with a focus\u00a0on environmental and ecological applications. Laboratory work is required.

The course adopts a political economy perspective to trace the complex interactions of institutions, politics, and economic systems that shape initiatives for more sustainable cities. Students will work in the first part of the course to enhance their understanding of core concepts and best practices that constitute the professional field of sustainable urban development and assemble a framework for analyzing the ways in which sustainability initiatives come to fruition and approach the idea of sustainability in a particular way. Equipped with these foundations, we then analyze case studies in the second part of course that focus on the meaning of sustainability, its practice internationally, and the ultimate impact of these practices on ecological balance, economic sustainability, and social equity in the urban environment. Toward these ends, students will conduct a semester-long senior capstone research project that investigates a particular urban sustainability initiative in the world by tracing the political economy of its creation and considering its impact on society, economy, and environment.

Geologists think planet Earth is incredibly exciting, but nowhere is the story of the behavior of our planet more dramatized and misrepresented than in movies! Whether they are big-budget thrillers like Jurassic Park, San Andreas, or The Day After Tomorrow, or low-brow science fiction like Boa, movies tend to stretch the reality of natural hazards and earth processes to great dramatic effect. In this course, we will have the opportunity to watch a variety of movie clips that focus on geologic hazards (such as volcanoes, earthquakes, avalanches, floods, and tsunamis) and other earth processes (origins of life, evolution, mass extinction, climate change, and glaciers). We will examine the scientific features and processes depicted in films, learn about their scientific basis, and critique the film's portrayal of earth process. Students will work in groups to examine a film centered on a geological process, and critique the way science is depicted. The final project gives you the opportunity to develop your own script for a movie that does the geology correctly. This course will cover quantitative concepts relevant to earth processes, such as describing the world quantitatively, understanding uncertainty and risk, and evaluating quality and sources of data.",

Some processes occur frequently across geographic boundaries and throughout geologic time (like rainsplash), while others are stochastic in nature and dramatic in their geomorphic signature (like glacial outburst floods). We will focus on the roles of rivers, glaciers, and mass movements in shaping landscapes, but will examine wide-ranging landscapes such as arid environments and coastal regions. The study of current surface processes on the Earth will be examined with an eye toward understanding the evolution of landscapes over geologic timescales.

However, humans can dramatically affect soil properties over a few years or decades. Through the lens of the minerals in soil, we will learn about soil formation, soil pollution, soil degradation, and soil regeneration. We will also look at how soils respond to, record, and influence changing climates. This course will especially focus on the magnetic minerals found in soils, their origins, and why they are such a powerful record of a soil's past.

Just a few years ago you ran into them anytime you walked into a bookstore or turned on the TV-just like in Victorian times when Bram Stoker's famous work emerged from a vampire craze. Vampires have always been popular fodder and will continue to be so, even if and as the image of the vampire shifts dramatically over time. The popularity of vampires has waxed and waned for over a hundred years, partially because vampirism can be used as a metaphor for almost anything-from the plague to sexuality to addiction. We will juxtapose classic tales of vampires as monsters with the more recent generation of vampires. What happened to change our imagination of vampires from monsters into hip, outsider superheroes? And what can the examination of vampires tell us about the context in which they were created?",

Ever more political theorists, environmentalists, and ecologists are turning to Spinoza\u2019s vision of a nonhierarchical union of nature and society that rejects anthropocentrism as the promise for a more equitable and sustainable life. In this course we shall focus on the foundation of Spinoza\u2019s unconventional thesis: his intertwined conceptions of the human being as part of nature\u2014as opposed to the prevailing notion of the human as an autonomous \u201cimperium\u201d in, yet above, nature\u2014and of society as a continuation of nature\u2014as opposed to the dominant theories of the \u201csocial contract\u201d that ground society on its break with, or repression of, nature (Grotius, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant). We shall examine Spinoza\u2019s entailed radical revision in understanding both the \u201cpolitical\u201d and the \u201cenvironment.\u201d Beyond Spinoza\u2019s Ethics and his Theologico-Political and Political treatises, we shall read major commentators both on Spinoza\u2019s ethical and political theory\u2014e.g., Louis Althusser, \u00c9tienne Balibar, Edwin Curley, Gilles Deleuze, Michael Hardt, Pierre Macherey, Warren Montag, Antonio Negri\u2014and on his role in environmental ethics and Deep Ecology\u2014e.g., Bill Devall, Leslie Le Grange, K.L.F.

While becoming familiar with the work of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Jacque Lacan, as well as the work of relevant thinkers who influenced their thought, we shall be examining the structural and conceptual homologies and differences among political economy, abstract thought, and human subjectivity. The last part of the course will focus on the relation between these interconnections (among economy, ideas, culture, and the constitution of identities) and the exercise of power in the era of global capitalism, as theorized by thinkers who draw on this German-French-speaking line of thought.  This is a core course toward the Critical Theory concentration; all readings and class taught in English; no pre-knowledge required.

Discussion topics include: \"human nature\" as a product of history; narrative as a way of \"doing\" philosophy; the master-slave dialectic; how an historical event like the French Revolution is part of \"philosophy\"; gender theory and Hegel's reading of Sophocles' \"Antigone.\" No prerequisites except a willingness to work through densely argued texts.

That plan failed, but a later experiment in unity succeeded when the united colonies declared independence. Nevertheless, social, cultural, and ideological differences persisted, and the union formed in 1776 was tried and tested before finally fracturing with the secession of South Carolina, precipitating the Civil War. In the intervening years, Americans grappled with how they should govern themselves, who should be included in the polity, and how society should be organized. Reformers considered the controversial issues of women's rights, the role of Native Americans within the US, and the place of slavery in a nation founded on the precept that \"All men are created equal.\" This course covers the periods of the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, the early national and antebellum periods, before concluding with the Civil War. It also considers the global causes and consequences of the war and the rise of the new United States.\u00a0We will also analyze the construction of the myth and historical memory of Alexander Hamilton, the founding father who has captured the imagination of people in the modern U.S.\u00a0\u00a0Through a study of the recent biography of Hamilton along with the music and stage production of\u00a0Hamilton, we will consider both the biographical and mythical Alexander Hamilton in order to understand his era and our own.

European (and, later, Euro-Americans) alternated among fascination, fear, and frustration toward American Indians, while American Indians sought to maintain tribal sovereignty and control over their lands, cultures, religions, politics, and lifestyles amidst continuing encroachment and settlement. This course examines American Indian history to 1871 - the year that Congress stopped making treaties with Native nations - by considering the complicated and multifaceted history of the nation's indigenous people. By looking at American Indian interactions with Spanish, French, British, and American explorers, settlers, missionaries, militaries, and government officials, this courses argues that the history of American Indians is essential to understanding past as well as present issues. Furthermore, this course looks to move beyond the notion that American Indian history is one of inevitable decline by creating a more nuanced understanding of the American Indian experience from pre-contact toward the twentieth century.

Students will view and analyze films that are among the essential Russian contributions to world cinema, by directors including Eisenstein, Tarkovsky, Mikhalkov, and Sokurov. Course readings will draw upon film theory, history, fiction, and memoirs. We will use our readings to create a conceptual framework for examining the films as narratives about real events, as vehicles of propaganda, and as imaginative works of art. In addition to attending weekly film screenings and discussing the films and readings in class, students will give presentations on topics of their choice arranged in consultation with the instructor.

This course explores the way that questions of health have shaped the African continent from the period of European colonization in the early twentieth century to today. We will explore topics such as the development of colonial public health infrastructure, the emergence of international health and development institutions during the period of African decolonization, and the continuing challenges that independent states in Africa today face dealing with both epidemic disease and preventative care. We will focus on a wide variety of public health issues, including insect-borne diseases like malaria and sleeping sickness, AIDS, cancer, malnourishment and malnutrition, infant and maternal health care, and Ebola. This course will give students a historical as well as a contemporary perspective on public health in African society and politics. In addition to our readings of leading scholars in this field, we will engage with historical documents, literature, and film. We will also continuously engage with contemporary news coverage over the course of the semester.

By reading important recent texts, this course tackles \"world\" questions: what does it mean to be from a certain place? what is a culture? and who are we in it?

The recognition of indigenous peoples' rights in international law invokes the tensions between sovereignty and human rights, but also challenges the dominant international understandings of both principles. In this course, we examine indigenous peoples' movements by placing them in a global context and sociologically informed theoretical framework. By beginning with a set of influential theoretical statements from social science, we will then use indigenous peoples' movements as case studies to examine the extent to which these theoretical perspectives explain and are challenged by case studies. We will then analyze various aspects of indigenous peoples' movements and the extent to which these aspects of the movement are shaped by global processes.",

The first is the hater's internal world and looks at how human nature, genetic structure/instincts, and individual psychology may foster hatred. The second is external, exploring the role history, culture, ideology, social structure, religion, and mass psychology play. The third seeks to apply the insights gained from the first two, asking: how might we break the devastating cycles of hatred so present in our world?

Capitalism more precisely is a historical social system and a way of being which now penetrates all forms of life: cultural, ecological, civic and more. This senior seminar aims to identify capitalism's origins and development, and interrogate its contemporary status. Thinkers such as Smith, Marx, and Braudel will loom, but readings will focus on works by Beaud, Weber, Tawney, Kotz, Wallerstein, and others. The course concludes with a significant research paper on a topic, relevant to the theme, of a student's choice. Prerequisite(s): Senior standing or permission of instructor.",

Questions to be investigated include: Should we call premodern visual-verbal narratives manga?  How is war recorded and presented in manga?  How can nonhuman and posthuman manga forms prepare us for the robot future?  Does the gender or sexuality of a reader influence reading practices?  Readings will include: Tezuka Osamu, Mizuki Shigeru, Moto Hagio, Takeuchi Naoko, and Yoshinaga Fumi.  For a final project, students will prepare a graphic essay that incorporates critical methodologies learned in class with primary source(s) of their choosing.

During this same year, immigrants represented 15% of the United States population while 53% of the foreign born migrants came from Latin America. At the same time, we are observing the securitization of the border that is resulting in the removal of individuals from the U.S. in large numbers, specifically Latino men. Fall 2020 coincides with the presidential election, and like other presidential election years, immigration is a contentious topic that often exacerbates anti-immigrant sentiments. Immigrant Voices in Times of Fear will examine recent U.S. immigration as part of a global (historical) phenomenon to understand how we got to where we are. While we will become familiar with immigration policies, we will pay attention to the experiences of immigrants, particularly those coming from Latin America. We will explore questions such as: What motivates people to migrate? How does migration reconfigure social relations, such as parental and community relations? What are the consequences of different frameworks of immigration policies (e.g., security, human rights, economic growth) for immigrants?",

In this course you will be trained to produce and recognize (almost) all the sounds which human languages make use of, and to develop a systematic way of analyzing and recording them. Since sounds are perceived as well as produced, you will also be introduced to the acoustic analysis of speech, learning how acoustic signals of frequency, amplitude, and duration are translated into visible, quantifiable images. You will learn the art of decoding these spectrograms into sounds and words and sentences. The linguistics laboratory contains several different programs for practicing and listening to sounds from many of the world's languages.

This course examines the intersection of language and music from a linguistic perspective. We will engage with questions such as: How can syntax, phonology, and morphology change between spoken and sung language? How do speakers of tone languages understand lyrics in sung melodies? Is hip hop different in different languages? What does it mean to study melody and rhythm in speech? Can music help people learn languages? How do drum- and whistle-languages work? How does music contribute to language revitalization? No musical ability is required. No prerequisite required.",

What does it mean for our relationships with animals and the environment when we talk about animals much more than we interact with them? We will look at the roles that non-human animals play in our lives by examining the language used to talk about them both in areas like industrial pork production and traditional stories. We\u2019ll look at metaphors, grammar, storytelling. How does the way we talk about animals reflect the ways we traditionally interact with them? With how we treat them? With the meanings associate with them? How does the discourse of the food industry obscure the individuality and well being of non-human animals?",

The objective of the class is to familiarize students of film theory and history with the language of cinema from the standpoint of production in order to deepen your appreciation and knowledge of the technical aspects of film/video and to develop your capacity to use video as a tool for research and communication. In this way, the course will be a combination of technical instruction, critical engagement, and creative exploration. We will analyze and employ a variety of filmmaking techniques as well as constructing narrative and non-narrative strategies for doing so. The focus of the course will be to familiarize you with some basic conventions of experimental, documentary, and narrative cinema. In each assignment, you will be encouraged to think about how formal decisions enhance and further narrative or thematic elements. We will thus pay very close attention to formal aspects of cinematic production: mise-en-scene. cinematography, editing, and sound design. In addition to this attention to form, success in the class will be dependent on a commitment to working through the technical aspects of video production (camera operation, lighting, editing software) in order to create short, original video pieces.

            "description": "This course focuses on the dialogue and mutual influence between the German- and French-speaking traditions of political economy and philosophical and theoretical thought, as it becomes evident in the relations among German Idealism, Phenomenology, Existentialism, Psychoanalysis, (post-)Structuralism, and their productive interconnections in the development of Critical Theory. While becoming familiar with the work of Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Jacque Lacan, as well as the work of relevant thinkers who influenced their thought, we shall be examining the structural and conceptual homologies and differences among political economy, abstract thought, and human subjectivity. The last part of the course will focus on the relation between these interconnections (among economy, ideas, culture, and the constitution of identities) and the exercise of power in the era of global capitalism, as theorized by thinkers who draw on this German-French-speaking line of thought. This is a core course toward the Critical Theory concentration; all readings and class taught in English; no pre-knowledge required. Students may take this offering for credit even if they took the same course Fall 2018; the material is different.",

Forster's Lucy Honeychurch, who \"entered into a more solid world when she opened the piano,\" to James Baldwin's Sonny, who \"moved in an atmosphere which wasn't like theirs at all,\" fictional musicians encounter trouble when negotiating the conflicting realms of art and society. Experts in one kind of expression, they fail in others. What draws these characters to music? What does it offer them? What is its value to us? In the musical novel and short story, we encounter music as an agent of violence, of consolation, of transcendence and redemption as well as damnation. We witness empathy through music, but we also learn that shared feeling can be both beautiful and dangerous, that music unites and divides. This course combines the close reading of literary texts (as well as works of literary theory and musicology) with the examination of the musical contexts that inform and inspire them. We will explore, for example, the relationship between Kazuo Ishiguro's novel The Unconsoled and Richard Wagner's music drama Parsifal. We will talk about syncopation in \"jazz\" by Charles Mingus and Toni Morrison. We will watch Marguerite Duras and Katherine Mansfield turn innocuous music lessons into spaces of wretchedness. We will try to understand what David Mitchell's young composer Robert Frobisher means when he says, \"One writes music because winter is eternal and because, if one didn't, the wolves and blizzards would be at one's throat all the sooner.\"",

Its central concerns are: (1) to understand the place of music in social and cultural life, (2) to gain an appreciation of the musical style and rhetoric that characterizes each of the periods we study, and (3) to develop students' abilities in communicating, in writing and the spoken word, what they have learned about this music and the culture in which it was produced. Course activities will take several forms, including lectures, musical analyses, and performances. Lectures will introduce key terms and concepts and will address broader concerns of cultural life (including composer biographies). In-class analysis and performance will lead to a more detailed understanding of key works. Examinations will test students' retention of course listening and lecture/discussion/reading material. Essays will give students the opportunity to delve deeper into critical and musical analysis, and to sharpen their prose, specifically with respect to writing about music. The course assumes no historical knowledge of the periods in question. However, basic skills in the analysis of music are necessary. Prerequisite(s): MUSI 113 or permission of instructor.",

But what exactly is this future we care so much about, and for what sort of future should we strive? This class introduces fundamental problems of philosophy by exploring metaphysical, epistemological and ethical problems about the future. We begin with the central concerns of philosophy itself: what is real? what do I know? what is good? what really matters? We then consider the puzzling nature of the future, which we value immensely, and worry about, as though it is fully real. Are the past and present more real than the future? This raises interesting questions of our moral attitude to the future: do we have obligations to persons and generations that do not yet exist or no longer exist? Might we have an obligation to ensure that someone does (or does not) exist in the future? Future humans will face ethical issues that are worth thinking about in the present. For example, is it acceptable for future humans to colonize other planets as past humans have colonized other continents? There are a number of threats (e.g. Covid-19) that may prevent a human future altogether: war; climate change, pandemics. How do we gauge these threats and act accordingly? And if it turns out we are doomed, how would this affect the meaning of the life we have left? If we survive, human nature is likely to undergo significant change with the rise of technologies like artificial intelligence, genetic engineering and biomedical enhancement. Are these enhancements good for us? Are we ready to become \u2018trans-human\u2019? Finally, how can we (in the present) ensure a good future for those to come?",

We will start by considering debates over freedom of speech, privacy, surveillance, and intellectual property: issues that pre-exist the development of the Internet, but which because of it have taken on new dimensions. From here we will go on to take up some ethical questions arising from four different domains of activity on the social web: gaming, social networking, blog/wiki developing, and \"hacktivism.\" In the third part of the course, we will consider broad questions connected to the integration of the Internet with devices other than the personal computer and mobile phone and which open the prospect of a world of integrated networked systems. What are some of the impacts of such integration on our everyday ethical relations with others and on the overall quality of our lives? How does being networked affect the meaning of being human?",

            "description": "\"Spirit is a bone,\" wrote Hegel, exploding traditional logic and by extension the way we think about ethics, politics, and society. Hegel's discovery that consciousness is an historical artifact cleared the way for neo-Marxist social theory (Adorno), feminism (Beauvoir, Irigaray), constructivist gender theory (Butler), to mention just a few who moved in the \"wake of Hegel.\" In this course, after familiarizing ourselves with relevant issues in Kant (Hegel's main foil), we will work through Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit with an eye to its significance for issues of critical and social theory. Discussion topics include: \"human nature\" as a product of history; narrative as a way of \"doing\" philosophy; the master-slave dialectic; how an historical event like the French Revolution is part of \"philosophy\"; gender theory and Hegel's reading of Sophocles' \"Antigone.\" No prerequisites except a willingness to work through densely argued texts. Weekly reading responses, 3 mid-length papers. Counts as a core course for the Critical Theory concentration.",

Because these are questions over which reasonable people may disagree, coming up with mutually agreeable answers requires extensive public discussion and debate. The citizen who can discover reliable evidence, make sound arguments, and reason well in the face of strong counter-arguments also embodies the very notion of a liberally educated person. Students will develop their argumentation skills by focusing on congressional debates that have powerfully shaped the United States, including slavery, Indian removal, woman's rights, war powers, and impeachment. \u00a0The course is well suited for students who wish to develop their analytic, oral, and written communication skills.",

These include issues such as world order, power, hierarchy, political violence, international law, development, religion, human rights, gender, humanitarianism and international organizations (such as the United Nations). The second is to introduce students to the different perspectives or intellectual frameworks for making sense of international relations (also known as global or world politics), including realist, liberal, constructivist, historical materialist, postcolonial and feminist approaches. The third is to encourage students to reflect on some of the ethical issues inherent in both the study and practice of international politics. Emphasis will also be placed on developing a range of critical, analytical, research and writing skills required for the further study of international politics. The course is thus intended to prepare students for advanced work in the field, although it is also appropriate for those merely seeking to satisfy an interest in the study of global politics.",

The relationships among work, wealth and well-being are a perennial concern and have been central to the study of political economy, since its inception in the mid- to late-18th century. How does work produce wealth for the individual and for society? How, or when, does individual and social wealth translate into individual and/or social well-being? And, how does the character of work affect individual well-being or happiness? This course will examine the answers given to these questions (and myriad corollary questions) by writers within the political economy tradition.",

            "description": "This course deals with the political thought of Latin Christendom (Western Europe) during the later Middle Ages (c. 1050 - c. 1550). This body of thought is worthy of sustained study for two reasons. First, it is one of the glories of human civilization. In seeking to answer the timeless question \"how we should live our lives as individuals\" and \"how we should live together in peace and justice\" late medieval political thinkers produced a body of political thought second to none in the history of human philosophical speculation. Second, late medieval political thought is worthy of study because it gave rise to many of the concepts that continue to shape our collective lives today (including state sovereignty, separation of church and state, constitutionalism, just war, property rights, \"the people,\" nationalism, democracy, rule-of-law, and human rights). Indeed, it is impossible to really understand contemporary political life without delving deeply into the way in which late medieval thinkers engaged with the big political issues of their day. The main goal of this course is to provide a solid introduction to the political thought of this crucially important era in human history. In it, we will critically examine the relevant works of thinkers such as St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, John of Paris, Marsilius of Padua, Bartolus of Sasseferato, and Baldus de Ubaldi. To the extent that they shed light on late medieval thought, we will also touch on classical political theorists such as Aristotle and Cicero as well as Muslim and Jewish thinkers such as ibn Sina, Moshe ben Maimon, and ibn Rusd.",

Ever more political theorists, environmentalists, and ecologists are turning to Spinoza\u2019s vision of a nonhierarchical union of nature and society that rejects anthropocentrism as the promise for a more equitable and sustainable life. In this course we shall focus on the foundation of Spinoza\u2019s unconventional thesis: his intertwined conceptions of the human being as part of nature\u2014as opposed to the prevailing notion of the human as an autonomous \u201cimperium\u201d in, yet above, nature\u2014and of society as a continuation of nature\u2014as opposed to the dominant theories of the \u201csocial contract\u201d that ground society on its break with, or repression of, nature (Grotius, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant). We shall examine Spinoza\u2019s entailed radical revision in understanding both the \u201cpolitical\u201d and the \u201cenvironment.\u201d Beyond Spinoza\u2019s Ethics and his Theologico-Political and Political treatises, we shall read major commentators both on Spinoza\u2019s ethical and political theory\u2014e.g., Louis Althusser, \u00c9tienne Balibar, Edwin Curley, Gilles Deleuze, Michael Hardt, Pierre Macherey, Warren Montag, Antonio Negri\u2014and on his role in environmental ethics and Deep Ecology\u2014e.g., Bill Devall, Leslie Le Grange, K.L.F.

Is there a point at which some of our traits are \"set,\" or do we retain the capacity to change throughout development? In this course, we will work to answer these questions and more. With a life-span approach, we will examine the theories and research that describe and explain our physical, cognitive, and social development from conception to death.

Exploring notions of femininity and masculinity, as well as attitudes towards homosexuality and transgendered populations, we witness their implications in case studies and stories, from a divorce court in Iran to a matriarchal utopia in India.",

He served four years of hard labor in prison and another five years in exile in Siberia. He suffered from debilitating epilepsy and a compulsive gambling habit, and he struggled with massive debt. Yet by the end of his life the Russian public hailed him as a prophet and Russia's greatest living writer. Like his life, his novels are extraordinary. They plumb the dark depths of the human soul, confronting the reader with issues of life and death, good and evil, and the presence of evil in God's universe. In this course we will read Dostoevsky's four great novels Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, Demons, and The Brothers Karamazov, as well as the misunderstood anti-nihilist work Notes from Underground.

            "description": "The Far Right in the United States has appropriated working class identities to produce an identity among the white working class. Donald Trump, for instance, intentionally portrays a large gap in highbrow and lowbrow to take jabs at privileged liberals (such as when he tweeted the \u201cHamberder\u201d photo). This course observes what can be called the Far Right \u201ctheater of politics\u201d in order to understand how liberals have left working class culture behind in ways that allowed the far right to fill the void by finding persuasive techniques in culture (country music, religion, church...) to articulate a political voice that some working class folks, especially whites, may find appealing. Some of the major questions of the course include: (1) How do political and economic elites produce class, gender, and racial divides and segmentations by aligning themselves with the cultural practices often associated with working class folks? (2) Can the left create a political culture that cultivates respect for organic cultural expressions that include religious expressions and pop-cultural themes like country music and sports (yes, even football!) into their fold? Reducing everything to class and asking all others to submit to its political logic is a limited vision. Instead, the course investigates whether it is possible to envision a political project that rather than privileging the concerns of upper-middle class whites produces a culture of resistance that can articulate working class subjects \u2013 straight, queer, white, black, binary, non-binary \u2013 into a populist left movement? One of the truly powerful features of the Left is that it is much more diverse than the Far Right. Is it possible to extend that diversity even further so that it can show a \u201clittle respect\u201d for organic cultural producers to feel comfortable producing and living in multiple class, racial, gender, and sexual habitus?",

What are the social consequences of these formal institutions of social control? In this course, we examine these developments in the processes and organization of social control, paying particular attention to criminal behavior and formal, legal responses to crime. We study and evaluate sociological theories of criminal behavior to understand how social forces influence levels of crimes. We examine recent criminal justice policies in the United States and their connections to inequality, examining the processes that account for expanding criminalization. Finally, we compare the development of formal, bureaucratic systems of social control and informal methods of social control, paying attention to the social and political implications of these developments.",

During this same year, immigrants represented 15% of the United States population while 53% of the foreign born migrants came from Latin America. At the same time, we are observing the securitization of the border that is resulting in the removal of individuals from the U.S. in large numbers, specifically Latino men. Fall 2020 coincides with the presidential election, and like other presidential election years, immigration is a contentious topic that often exacerbates anti-immigrant sentiments. Immigrant Voices in Times of Fear will examine recent U.S. immigration as part of a global (historical) phenomenon to understand how we got to where we are. While we will become familiar with immigration policies, we will pay attention to the experiences of immigrants, particularly those coming from Latin America. We will explore questions such as: What motivates people to migrate? How does migration reconfigure social relations, such as parental and community relations? What are the consequences of different frameworks of immigration policies (e.g., security, human rights, economic growth) for immigrants?",

The recognition of indigenous peoples' rights in international law invokes the tensions between sovereignty and human rights, but also challenges the dominant international understandings of both principles. In this course, we examine indigenous peoples' movements by placing them in a global context and sociologically informed theoretical framework. By beginning with a set of influential theoretical statements from social science, we will then use indigenous peoples' movements as case studies to examine the extent to which these theoretical perspectives explain and are challenged by case studies. We will then analyze various aspects of indigenous peoples' movements and the extent to which these aspects of the movement are shaped by global processes.",

Both historical and transatlantic in scope, the course focuses on issues such as poverty, slavery, class conflict, gender and ethnic discrimination, and migration in a variety of texts ranging from the 16th to the 21st century. The list of marginalized and subaltern subjects that we will examine includes, but is not limited to, the rogue or p\u00edcaro, the slave, the prostitute, the abused spouse, the homosexual, and the immigrant. While its thematic content will appeal to a myriad of students, the course aims both at refining textual analysis and providing a comprehensive view of the evolution of Hispanic fiction. It is thus particularly targeted at those who enjoy literature and believe in the pleasure of the text. The course will require short written essays and a longer, more formal, end-of-term paper that must make use of appropriate bibliographical sources. All sessions and course materials will be in English. Both the professor and the students will determine topics of discussion according to their own interests.",

Leaning on all of their previous experience with the language, the course seeks to enrich and complement the students' linguistic repertoire by further developing their communicative abilities, both verbal and written, especially in an academic context. Class content will focus on Latin America and the U.S. Latinx population. Students will gain increased confidence in the language and will strengthen their identity as bilinguals and abilities to interact with a more diverse group of speakers, pursue higher-level courses and/or apply this knowledge in their professional endeavors, inside or outside the United States. This course is the equivalent to SPAN 305\u00a0for those interested in the Spanish major or minor. (Students cannot earn credit for both 305 and 306). Prerequisite(s): Course has no explicit prerequisite but is designed for those who grew up speaking Spanish at home, with extended families and in their communities.",

The seventeenth century Hispanic world reveals surprisingly diverse and complex societies in which literature-and sometimes life itself-provided a space for trying on different social clothes, so to speak, in an exploration of early modern identity. This course will allow students to enjoy prose, drama, poetry and historiography from both Spain and Spanish America and to witness how writers from both sides of the Atlantic were pushing aesthetic and societal limits of religion, ethnicity and gender in their writing. We view Baroque art from Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, and colonial Mexico and Peru, and read some pertinent critical perspectives that will help enrich our readings of the literature. To bring the plays to life, students will select fragments of dramas to \"rescript\" and perform for their classmates. This course satisfies the Area 1 requirement for the Spanish major.

It centers on the literature and the arts during the periods of the Enlightenment, Romanticism, Realism, and the Avant-Garde. The period from 1800 to 1936 is crucial to the development of art. We will examine critical issues such as the limits of authority and the freedom of choice; the origins of modern subjectivity/ the pursuit of the ideal and the impossible; the conflict between individualism and nationalism, and that between empire and colonies; the rise of the bourgeoisie and the transition to a secular world; the crisis of reason; and the autonomy of art. Our goal will be to shed light on the Janus-faced mingling of progress with tradition that defines modernity in the Hispanic world. to this end, we will deal with the social, cultural, aesthetic and political dimensions that shape the evolution of literature and the arts during the 19th- and the first half of the 20th- centuries. This course satisfies the area 2 requirement for the Spanish major. Prerequisite(s): SPAN 307\u00a0or consent of the instructor.",

In this course, we'll examine frameworks of thinking, statistical tools, and study designs that enable us to learn about the causal effects of interventions. Some specific topics include graphical causal models, randomized experiments, propensity score methods, instrumental variables, and interrupted time series designs.

In fact, Time Magazine declared in 2014 that we are at the \u201ctransgender tipping point.\u201d And yet, alongside this positive media coverage, we see legislatures across the country debated so-called \u201cbathroom bills\u201d that foment fear of the transsexual child predator, bills that would limit or criminalize gender-affirming medical care, as well as bills seeking to define sex in order to prevent trans athletes from participating in school and collegiate sports. In all of these instances, it\u2019s useful to consider how and why the specter of transness is raised. What social and political work does that figure do? This course will examine transness as a practice of gender transgression, rather than solely an identity category, one which is historically and geographically contingent. In doing so, we will ask: What is trans? How do race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability structure trans lives and communities? How have key institutions within the US constructed ideas about gender normativity and policed gender transgression? How has that policing impacted and shaped trans life? What is the relationship between feminism and trans people and trans liberation? How have trans people envisioned and fought for social justice? What space can trans open up for new ways of living, relating, and imagining otherwise? Prerequisite: Any previous WGSS course or permission of instructor.",

Some topics: protest against gender, sexual, race, economic, and linguistic bio-regimes, revolts of the colonized and marginalized, and resistant/ liberatory creations in art, technology, and media. Authors include Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Michel Foucault, Theresa Cha, Silvia Federici, Noam Chomsky, Ta-Nehisi Coates, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, and Gayatri Spivak, among others.
